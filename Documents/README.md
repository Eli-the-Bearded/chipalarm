Chip Alarm Sound
----------------

The audio file here, `curve.wav`, was taken from the Ubuntu packaged
version of Libreoffice, which is distributed under the Mozilla Public
License 2.0 (see Mozilla-Public-License-2.0.txt). It is the sound file
I like to use for an alarm, but it is by no means the only sound that
can be used.
